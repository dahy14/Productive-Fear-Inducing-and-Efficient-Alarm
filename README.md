# Productive-Fear-Inducing-and-Efficient-Alarm

## Hi, if you have trouble programming
If you are using __VSCODE__, then this is for you. 

You can run the pyw script or you can run the executable file in the dist folder. 
What it will it do is for you to discover. 
The alarm is triggered when your __VCODE__ is not open.
